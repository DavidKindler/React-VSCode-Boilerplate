https://www.qualcomm.com/api/menus
There are seven menus in an array from api/menus
Each has key of name and an items array 
mlid key refers to key for present menu item
plid key refers to key for parent menu

main menu name is "menu-ember" which is first array item.
items array has top level menu items (products, solutions, inventions, news, company)

** products
products has array of children [Products, product finder, product categories, brands]
first item - products - has no children, icon, expanded is set to 1, depth is 2
second item - product finder - has no children, no icon, expanded set to 0, depth is 2
third item - product categories, has children, no icon, expanded set to 1, depth is 1 (no link)
    first level of children are shown (depth: 3)
fourth item - brands, has childre, no icon, expanded set to 1, depth is 2, (no link)
    first level of children are shown (depth: 3)

Depth 3 and 4 are shown as dropdowns at top of page.


** solutions
solutions has array of children shown in secondary menu as 
each child has expanded set to 0 (this seems to determine if there is another sub-level panel)
another key (second_pane_enabled) is set to true but not all children have this key.  Unclear what this does.

expanded is set to 0.

*********************************************************************
Logic for nav

Show first level list with icons 
Click on link (change to X) 
open second panel with children (array) - need component for second and third level panels
Build list - list item without path is label, if it has children it opens another panel?

*********** Components needed
main nav with flat list of parents
need to handle if home/not home, search and secondary menu (more...) - which is another component to component

menu panel slides out shows secondary list of menu items
Need to determine if third panel is needed (how is this done?)
If links have children then we open a third panel (new component).

breadcrumb component - shows parent - child relation shop in dropdown list.
